# BlahBlahBlah
A twitter-like class project, by Laura Luaciu and Willis Hand. 

## Phase 1
Phase 1 is encapsulated in Phase1.jpg

## Phase 2
The eztwitt directory contains the website for phase 2. It's home page is Page.php. Refer to the readme inside the eztwitt directory for more information.

## Phase 3
BlahBlahBlah is a project directory for the android app. We chose to implement the following queries:
- Query 3, the user can search for a word and see how many times that word has occured in each location
- Query 4, user can search for another user, and see all of their posts
- Query 7, after login, user can create a new post
- Query 9, after login, user can comment on a post <br /> 
LOG_REST.php should be placed in the htdocs directory, so that the app can reach it. The queries are implemented in that file.
